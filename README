PyDayDBZ is a script which makes it easier for admins having their own hives to modify the database.

REQUIRES MYSQL FOR PYTHON!
I will be working on having it included by default.

commands:

user <nick>
show (info/inventory/backpack/storage)
add (inventory/backpack) <item>
save
kill <user>
ress <user>
check <user>


I am not responsible for corrupt userfiles.
Also note you need to be in the LOBBY OF THE SERVER for this to work, as the database gets updated after logout.

edit the serverconfig file with ip, username, password (nothing for blank) and database.

Windows only.
